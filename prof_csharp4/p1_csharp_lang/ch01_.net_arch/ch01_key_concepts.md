## Namespaces

_Namespaces_ are the way that .NET avoids name clashes between classes. They are designed to prevent situations in which you define a class to represent a customer, name your class __Customer__, and then someone else does the same thing.

_If a namespace is not explicitly supplied, the type will be added to a nameless global namespace._
